so there the idea

Suppose we have two numbers x1 and x2 and we want (x1 -x2) to be divisible by k

and we know that if both numbers are divisible by k then if we subtract them they will also be divisible by k

for example K=2   (4-2) is divisible by 2 because ( 4 is divisible by 2 )  and ( 2 is also divisible by 2 ).

 

so what x%k give us ?? it give us if we add x%k or subtract x%k from that number it will became divisible by k

for example: k=5 and x=2   (5%2) = 1  if we add 1 to 5 it will became 6 which is divisible by 2 and if we subtract 1 from 5 it will became 4 which is also divisible by 2

 

so what we will do we will check and can i get arr[i]%k from any previous number so that i will add arr[i]%k to my current number  and subtract arr[i]%k to my previous number to make both the numbers divisible by k .

for example:  [5,7]    K=2

  5%2 = 1 // subtract one to make it divisible by K

  7%2 =1 // needs one to make it divisible by K

or vice versa 

 

we will take one from 5 to make it divisible by K*/

            res+=map[arr[i]%k];  

          }

          map[arr[i]%k]++;
