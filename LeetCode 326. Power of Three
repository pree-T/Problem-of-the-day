class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return n > 0 && !(1162261467 % n);
    }
};
Max number that is power of 3 and that fits into int upper limit is3**19 (aka 1162261467).
This number3**19 is divisible by any number that is <= and is power of 3.
For example:

3**19 / 27 = 3**19 / 3**3 = 3**16
Meaning: 3**19 % 27 == 3**19 % 3**3 == 0
